# Brain-AlexNet-Similarity

Comparing representations in artificial neural networks against representations in biological systems is a promising framework for testing computational theories of the mind. This project focuses on developing new metrics for evaluating the similarity between biological and artificial neural models, which will be critical in developing strong computational theories of the mind in this rapidly evolving ecosystem of model-brain comparisons.
